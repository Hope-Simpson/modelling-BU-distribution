# modelling-BU-distribution
Set of scripts implementing the biomod2 package to model relationships between Buruli ulcer and M. ulcerans distributions and environmental predictors, and then to predict their occurrence in Africa.
Buruli ulcer is a skin disease caused by the environmental bacterium Mycobacterium ulcerans. In Africa, the disease occurs mostly in the tropical and subtropical regions and shows a distinct focal pattern. In this modelling work, we aimed to predict the environmental niche of the disease and bacterium based on statistical relationships with a set of environmental variables, and then projected the model across the African continent to identify regions where their niches were met. We used occurrence points extracted from published literature and a set of environmental predictors, and the biomod2 package in R. This work has been submitted for publication in PLoS NTDs. If you have any questions or suggestions I would be pleased to hear from you!
